\textbf{\Large ABSTRACT}\\
\end{center}

\begin{normalsize}
The increasing global waste generation has elevated waste management to critical concern. It is
observed that globally solid waste has surged, hitting 2.01 billion tons annually in 2016, with
predictions of 3.40 billion tons by 2050. Such vast amounts of waste can lead to severe
environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity and generation of green house gases which have
a long-lasting effect on planet. Existing methods, relying on manual sorting and implementation
of IOT. All of the reviewed surveys focus on object detection and a few on waste detection and classification but none of them surveyed the available dataset and the deep learning models for multiple object detection on the waste detection and classification . This project proposes deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and Mask regional convolutional neural networks (MRCNNs), to address these challenges and
enhance waste management. The proposed method involves training deep learning models on a
comprehensive dataset of waste materials, enabling automated and accurate sorting based on
visual and textual characteristics. This project's significance lies in its potential to revolutionize
waste management by automating classification and recycling processes, reducing human labor,
enhancing recycling efficiency, and minimizing waste sent to landfills, thereby reducing
environmental pollution and conserving resources. Therefore, it provides the way for smarter and
more sustainable waste management practices, contributing to a cleaner and healthier planet.

\end{figure}\\
The system starts with data collection and preprocessing. Workers gather images containing various types of waste, like plastic bottles, metal cans, or paper products.  These images are then formatted for the machine learning model, which involves resizing them or adjusting color levels.The core of the system is a Mask R-CNN model, a type of deep learning algorithm adapt at object detection and segmentation. This model is trained on the preprocessed data. During training, the model analyzes the images, learning to recognize features that distinguish between different waste types and their backgrounds.Once trained, the model can be used to analyze new images. As the image enters the system, the Mask R-CNN model identifies and outlines the waste objects within the image. It then classifies the waste based on the features it recognizes.  For instance, it might classify an image containing a plastic soda bottle as “plastic”. Finally, based on the classification, the system recommends a recycling method. If the image contained a plastic soda bottle, the system might recommend recycling it in a plastic bin.

\textbf{4.1.1 SVM}\\
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning
algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Its primary goal is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space. In classification, SVM aims to create a decision boundary (hyperplane) that maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the closest data points of different classes known as support vectors. These support vectors are the critical data
points that influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. SVM can handle linear and nonlinear data by using different kernel functions (like polynomial, radial basis function, etc.) that map the data into higher-dimensional spaces where classes are more separable. For regression tasks, SVM employs a similar principle by finding a hyperplane that best fits the data within a certain margin of tolerance. It aims to minimize errors while maximizing the margin, thus finding the optimal fit for the given data. SVM is effective in handling high-dimensional data, works well with a clear margin of separation between classes, and is robust against over fitting when the right parameters are chosen. However, it can be sensitive to noise
and might become computationally expensive with large data sets.

%\textbf{4.2 Modules}\\
\textbf{ 4.2.1 Object Detection}\\
Object detection involves a comprehensive process that not only identifies and localizes objects within an image but also provides detailed segmentation masks for each detected object. Mask R-CNN builds on the Faster R-CNN framework by adding a branch specifically designed for predicting segmentation masks, which allows for pixel-level precision in object delineation. This process starts with a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone, such as ResNet or ResNeXt, which is used to extract rich feature maps from the input image. These feature maps are then processed by a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate candidate regions of interest (RoIs) that likely contain objects. The RoIs are fed into the RoIAlign layer, which ensures that the features are precisely aligned with the original image, maintaining spatial accuracy and improving the overall quality of the detection and segmentation tasks. Within each proposed region, the model performs classification to determine the object class and bounding box regression to refine the coordinates of the bounding boxes, ensuring accurate localization of the objects. Simultaneously, the mask branch generates a binary mask for each class within the RoIs, predicting the shape and extent of the object at a pixel level. This combination of classification, bounding box regression, and segmentation makes Mask R-CNN particularly powerful for applications that require detailed understanding and separation of individual objects, such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and video surveillance. The detailed segmentation masks provided by Mask R-CNN enhance its utility in scenarios where precise object boundaries are critical for further analysis or processing.\\

\textbf{4.2.2 Object clasification}\\
Object classification in Mask R-CNN (MRCNN) involves identifying and categorizing objects within an image while also providing detailed segmentation masks. Mask R-CNN is an extension of the Faster R-CNN model, with an added branch for predicting segmentation masks for each object. The process begins with a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone, such as ResNet, which extracts feature maps from the input image. These feature maps are processed by a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate candidate object regions. Each region of interest (RoI) proposed by the RPN is then refined through the RoIAlign layer, which ensures precise spatial alignment of the features. The refined features are passed through two branches: the classification and bounding box regression branch, and the mask prediction branch. The classification branch assigns a class label to each RoI indicates classification. while the bounding box regression branch adjusts the coordinates of the bounding boxes for better localization. The mask prediction branch generates a binary mask for each class within the RoI, providing pixel-level segmentation of the object. This dual capability of classification and segmentation makes Mask R-CNN particularly useful for tasks requiring both high-level categorization and detailed understanding of object shapes and boundaries. Applications of object classification in Mask R-CNN include autonomous driving, where precise object recognition is crucial for navigation, and medical imaging, where detailed classification and segmentation of anatomical structures are necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.\\

\textbf{4.2.3 Recommending Recycling Methods}\\
Recommending recycling methods for waste detected in a geo waste classification system using deep neural networks involves a sophisticated process that integrates advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The system employs deep neural networks, such as Mask R-CNN, to accurately detect and classify various types of waste in geographic areas, utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones like ResNet for feature extraction and Region Proposal Networks (RPNs) for proposing candidate regions of interest. These regions are refined through RoIAlign layers to ensure precise alignment of features, facilitating accurate classification and segmentation of waste objects. Subsequently, a recommendation module leverages the classification results to suggest suitable recycling methods for each waste type based on a pre-defined recycling database. The system outputs comprehensive information, including waste types, locations, and recommended recycling methods, providing valuable insights for waste management authorities to optimize recycling efforts.
